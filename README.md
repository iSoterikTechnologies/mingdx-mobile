With the help of an awesome android app, `AIDE`, we can use minGDX to quicky prototype games with an Android device! How cool is that! :)

# Usage
You need to install [AIDE](https://www.android-ide.com/), it is available in the playstore. AIDE is not free though, you may have to pay in order to run large projects.

All the features of minGDX are ported to your Android device and everything works like before. However, setiing up a project on your Android can be tedious, so
we develped a setup tool for quickly creating a minGDX project. The tool will include all the necessary files needed to run minGDX projects. Learn how to use the setup tool
[here](https://github.com/iSoterikTechnologies/mingdx-setup).
